# Ethereum Block Explorer
This project is an ethereum block explorer using ReactJS. Blockexplorers give us the ability to view lots of different information about the blockchain including data about:
  * the blockchain network itself
  * blocks in the blockchain
  * transactions in a block
  * accounts
  * and many other things
  
[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a good example of an Ethereum blockexplorer.

## Getting Started

Clone this project to pull down code.

After that cd into the base directory of the project and run `npm install` to download all the project dependencies.

## 1. Create a unique Alchemy API key

If you have not already done so, create a unique Alchemy API Mainnet key
for your project as [described here](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/api-overview?a=eth-bootcamp).

## 2. Add your API key to as an environment variable for the project

Create an empty `.env` file in the base directory of this project.

Add the following line to the `.env` file replacing `YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` with your api key.

```sh
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
```

Do not remove the `REACT_APP_` prefix. React uses that to import env variables.


## 3. Start the webserver

`npm start`

Running the command above will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The webpage will automatically reload when you make code changes.
